<h2>Lab 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a program that prints a square.</li>
<li>Write a program that prints the numbers</li>
<li>
Write a program that does the following
1.	Take two Integer inputs from the user. (Hint: Use input() function )
2.	Add two Integer inputs and prints the answer.
</li>
</ul>

Question 1: Let’s build a calculator.

Write a program that takes the following inputs
1.	Two numbers
2.	One operator ( +, -, *, /, or %)

The program then should perform the operation on two numbers and should print an answer.

Question 2: Attendance checker

A student will not be allowed to sit in an exam if his/her attendance is less than 75%.

Write a program that takes the following input from a user
●	Number of classes held
●	Number of classes attended.

And prints
●	percentage of class attended
●	If a student is allowed to sit in the exam or not.

Question 1: Calculate Factorial

Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1*2*3*....*(n-1)*n. E.g.-
4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24
3! = 3*2*1 = 6
2! = 2*1 = 2
Also,
1! = 1
0! = 1


Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number.

  Question 3: Calculate the average

Write a program that takes integer inputs from the user until he/she presses q ( Ask to press q to quit after every integer input ). Print average and product of all numbers.



  </li>
  
  
  <li>
  Question 4: Calculate the average

Write a program that calculates the average of all elements in the following array/list

my_list= [1,22,32,12,55,88,76,54,2,1,22,33,44,5,6,6,7,5,0]

  Question 1: The Collatz Conjecture
 
http://xkcd.com/710


The Collatz Conjecture states that if you pick a number, and repeat a certain procedure, you will eventually arrive at the number 1 for any given natural number input. 

The procedure is as follows: 
●	If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1  (3n+1) 
●	If the number is even, divide it by 2 (n/2)


Please write code that can take a positive integer input, check this conjecture, and print the “Collatz chain” as well as the total length of the chain. Refer to the below screenshot for further details:

  Question 2: Nested loops

Kenny is a big fan of the rectangle. “It’s like a square, in that its angles are all equal, but its adjacent sides don’t have to be equal! Wicked!” he says, when asked about the shape. 

Kenny likes rectangles so much that he decided to write a Python function rectangle(l,b) that, given a length and breadth as arguments, uses asterisks (“*”) to print out a simple rectangle on the screen. He then uses this function to draw a crude flag according to user-given specifications. 

A screenshot of the code in action is given below. Can you write code to do this so that you, too, can pay homage to the mighty rectangle?

  Question 3: Lucky 7 in LUDO

Write a program that 
1.	Asks users to tell how many times the two LUDO six-sided dice should be rolled.
2.	Returns the result of a randomized roll of two six-sided dice. This means that two random integer values between 1 and 6 (inclusive) need to be returned. 

Hint
To make a six-sided dice, you must use the methods available in the random module. See the example below.

import random
no = random.randint(1,6)



If the sum of two dies is 7, we call this a lucky event.

Your program should 
1.	keep track of the number of times the sum of the two die turn out to be 7
2.	print out how many times this lucky event occurred. 

The sample output given below should clarify the question’s requirements.
